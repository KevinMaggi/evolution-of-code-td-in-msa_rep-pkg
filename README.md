# Analysis of the Evolution of Code Techinical Debt in Microservices Architectures

Replication package for the master thesis work entitled:
> Kevin Maggi. 2023. "Analysis of the Evolution of Code Techinical Debt in Microservices Architectures".

in Computer Engineering at University of Florence, under the supervision of Ph.D. Roberto Verdecchia and Prof. Enrico Vicario and co-supervision of Ph.D. Leonardo Scommegna

It contains all the material required for replicating the study, including: scripts and configurations for the dataset selection, scripts and configurations for the data mining (i.e. dataset code quality analysis via Sonar tool suite), and scripts for statistical data analysis.

## Quick start
Here a documentation on how to use the replication material should be provided.

### Getting started

- Creating dataset:

        python3 -m src.0_dataset_creation

- Mining repositories:

        python3 -m src.1_mining

- Analyzing data:

        Rscript src/2_data_analysis.R
